# CAD design
The RC car consists of a simple chassis that uses two servos for power. One turns the car via a rack and pinion in the front, and the other connects to the back via neutral spur gears

## Why does this exist
We made this project because our origional project, the robotic centipede, was not able to be completed due to stepper driver fuckery and the lack of print time. But we were able to take some things we learned writing the code for that project into the creation of this one!
